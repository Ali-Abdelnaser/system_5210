  "aboutWhoWeAreContent": "We are a team of fourth-year Mass Communication students at the Canadian International College (CIC). We are committed to promoting preventive health for children and spreading awareness of healthy daily habits within Egyptian families in a simple and practical way. Our idea was inspired by the noticeable increase in children’s reliance on processed foods, reduced physical activity, and excessive screen time, and the direct impact these habits have on their physical and mental well-being. From this observation, we developed an application based on the 5·2·1·0 principle as a clear and practical framework to help families organize a healthier daily routine without complexity.",
  "aboutAppConceptTitle": "The App Concept",
  "aboutAppConceptContent": "The application is built around the 5·2·1·0 concept:\n• 5 servings of fruits and vegetables\n• 2 hours of screen time maximum\n• 1 hour of physical activity daily\n• 0 added sugar\nThe concept is delivered through:\n– Simplified educational content\n– Practical tips for mothers\n– Daily reminders for children\n– Interactive activities within the family\nThe application does not provide medical diagnoses or treatment plans. Instead, it aims to support the development of sustainable healthy habits.",
  "aboutVisionTitle": "Our Vision",
  "aboutVisionContent": "To make healthy habits a natural part of every child’s daily life and to position families as essential partners in this positive change.",
